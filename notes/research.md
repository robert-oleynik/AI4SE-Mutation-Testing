# Questions to Research

- Is such approach suitable for generating Mutants?
- How do AI mutants differ from normally generated mutants?
- How to force a LLM to generate different Algorithms and not replicating the behavior? (Is this even a problem?)
- Does a LLM give a performance advantage against simple/standard mutation testing?
- Does a LLM perform better on generating mutants then a standard mutation test tool.
